# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
Provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time on an HTML webpage. Javascript was used to display the UFOs sightings' data as a table and manipulate the data by adding filters; The related article, data to support findings, and easy-to-use filters to fine-tune the results were all included on the webpage.

## Results 
Upon entering the website, the users will see not only the title and the article relates to UFO sightings but also the table of UFOs sightings.

If users desire to search for particular events base on different criteria, they can simply write in any of the Date, City, State, Country, or Shape filter boxes in the Filter Search section located on the left of the table. Users can choose to apply single or multiple filters. The corresponding events after filtering will be displayed on the table base on the user input. Filters can be reseted by pressing the 'UFO Sightings' on the very top of the webpage.

## Summary
One major drawback about this webpage is that because the dataset is not large, the sightings included in this site are only for the Jan of 2010. Therefore users are not able to find sightings that occurred outside of this time. 

Additional recommendations include adding the sighting's duration filter in the Filter Search section and adding drop-down menus for the filter boxes for better navigation. It would also be nice to have a site that could constanly update new UFO sightings into the table section of the webpage.
